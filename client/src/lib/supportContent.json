Here's the procedure:\n1. Turn ignition to ON (don't start engine)\n2. Press and hold the SELECT/RESET button on the steering wheel\n3. Hold for about 10 seconds until the oil life resets to 100%\n4. Turn off ignition\n\nThat's it! Takes 15 seconds. 👍\n```\n\n**Complex Diagnostic:**\n```\nYou: 2018 F-150 5.0L, P0171 and P0174 codes, rough idle, no vacuum leaks found\n\nMadness: 🔍 **Dual Bank Lean Codes - F-150 5.0L**\n\nBoth banks lean with no vacuum leaks? Let's dig deeper...\n\n**Most Likely Causes:**\n1. **MAF sensor contamination** (70% probability)\n   - Check for oil on sensor element\n   - Test: Unplug MAF, if idle improves = bad MAF\n   \n2. **Fuel pressure issue** (20%)\n   - Spec: 55-65 PSI at idle\n   - Check fuel filter (often overlooked)\n   \n3. **PCV system restriction** (10%)\n   - Check PCV valve and hoses\n\n**Diagnostic Steps:**\n1. Clean MAF with CRC MAF cleaner ($8.99)\n2. Check fuel pressure with gauge\n3. Inspect PCV system\n\n**Parts You Might Need:**\n- [Motorcraft MAF Sensor - $89.99](link)\n- [Fuel Filter - $24.99](link)\n\nWhat's your fuel pressure reading?\n```\n\n### Understanding Madness's Responses\n\nMadness always formats responses with:\n- **🔧 Bold headings** for main topics\n- **Bullet points** for lists and steps\n- **Emojis** for visual clarity 🚗⚙️🔍\n- **Clickable links** for parts (in blue)\n- **Step-by-step procedures** numbered clearly\n\n### Continuing the Conversation\n\n**MadnessBot remembers everything in your conversation!**\n\nYou can:\n- Ask follow-up questions\n- Request clarification\n- Go deeper into diagnostics\n- Switch topics (Madness tracks it all)\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: What's your fuel pressure reading?\n\nMadness: I'm seeing 52 PSI at idle\n\nYou: That's a bit low. Spec is 55-65. Check your fuel filter first - \nit's cheap and often the culprit. If pressure is still low after \nfilter replacement, you're looking at a weak fuel pump.\n\nLabor time: 0.5 hours for filter, 2.5 hours for pump.\n```\n\n---"

Profundicemos...\n\n**Causas Más Probables:**\n1. **Contaminación del sensor MAF** (70% de probabilidad)\n   - Verifique si hay aceite en el elemento sensor\n   - Prueba: Desconecte el MAF, si el ralentí mejora = MAF defectuoso\n   \n2. **Problema de presión de combustible** (20%)\n   - Especificación: 55-65 PSI en ralentí\n   - Verifique el filtro de combustible (a menudo se pasa por alto)\n   \n3. **Restricción del sistema PCV** (10%)\n   - Verifique la válvula PCV y las mangueras\n\n**Pasos de Diagnóstico:**\n1. Limpie el MAF con limpiador CRC MAF ($8.99)\n2. Verifique la presión de combustible con un manómetro\n3. Inspeccione el sistema PCV\n\n**Piezas que Podría Necesitar:**\n- [Sensor MAF Motorcraft - $89.99](link)\n- [Filtro de Combustible - $24.99](link)\n\nWhat's your fuel pressure reading?\n```\n\n### Entendiendo las Respuestas de Madness\n\nMadness siempre formatea las respuestas con:\n- **🔧 Encabezados en negrita** para los temas principales\n- **Viñetas** para listas y pasos\n- **Emojis** para claridad visual 🚗⚙️🔍\n- **Enlaces clicables** para piezas (en azul)\n- **Procedimientos paso a paso** numerados claramente\n\n### Continuar la Conversación\n\n**¡MadnessBot recuerda todo en su conversación!**\n\nUsted puede:\n- Hacer preguntas de seguimiento\n- Solicitar aclaraciones\n- Profundizar en los diagnósticos\n- Cambiar de tema (Madness rastrea todo)\n\n**Ejemplo:**\n```\nYou: What's your fuel pressure reading?\n\nMadness: I'm seeing 52 PSI at idle\n\nYou: That's a bit low.

Sin embargo, siempre verifique la información crítica y siga las especificaciones del fabricante.\n\n**P: ¿Puede MadnessBot diagnosticar cualquier vehículo?**\nR: MadnessBot tiene conocimiento de automóviles, camiones, motocicletas, embarcaciones y aeronaves. Si pregunta sobre un vehículo inexistente, Madness se lo hará saber.\n\n**P: ¿Cómo funciona el inventario de herramientas?**\nR: Usted le indica a Madness qué herramientas posee, y las rastrea en una base de datos. Puede verificar lo que tiene, agregar nuevas herramientas, eliminar herramientas y comprobar si tiene todo lo necesario para un trabajo específico.\n\n**P: ¿Son precisos los precios de las piezas?**\nR: MadnessBot busca en sitios web de proveedores reales para obtener precios actuales. Los precios pueden variar según la ubicación y la disponibilidad. Siempre verifique antes de realizar el pedido.\n\n**P: ¿Cuánto tardan en generarse los videos?**\nR: Generalmente de 30 a 60 segundos. Los videos más largos (20-25 segundos) pueden tardar hasta 90 segundos.\n\n**P: ¿Puedo guardar los videos de forma permanente?**\nR: Los videos caducan después de aproximadamente 1 hora. Haga clic en el botón de descarga para guardarlos permanentemente en su dispositivo.\n\n### Suscripción\n\n**P: ¿Qué sucede cuando finaliza mi prueba?**\nR: Se le pedirá que actualice a Premium.

Recomendamos usar una sola pestaña para mantener todo en una conversación.\n\n**P: ¿MadnessBot funciona en computadoras antiguas?**\nR: Siempre que tenga un navegador moderno, MadnessBot debería funcionar. Las computadoras muy antiguas (más de 10 años) pueden tener problemas con la reproducción de video.\n\n### Seguridad y Precisión\n\n**P: ¿Debo confiar en los diagnósticos de MadnessBot?**\nR: MadnessBot es una herramienta potente, pero no reemplaza su experiencia y criterio. Siempre verifique la información crítica, siga las especificaciones del fabricante y utilice procedimientos de seguridad adecuados.\n\n**P: ¿Qué pasa si MadnessBot da información incorrecta?**\nR: Aunque es raro, la IA puede cometer errores. Si nota información incorrecta, infórmenos a support@madnessbot.com para que podamos mejorar.\n\n**P: ¿Puede MadnessBot ayudar con sistemas críticos para la seguridad?**\nR: Sí, pero siempre siga los procedimientos del fabricante para sistemas críticos para la seguridad (frenos, dirección, bolsas de aire, etc.). MadnessBot proporciona orientación, pero usted es responsable de las reparaciones seguras.\n\n---"

Vamos aprofundar...\n\n**Causas mais prováveis:**\n1. **Contaminação do sensor MAF** (70% de probabilidade)\n   - Verifique se há óleo no elemento\n   - Teste: Desconecte o MAF; se a marcha lenta melhorar, é o MAF\n   \n2. **Problema de pressão de combustível** (20%)\n   - Especificação: 55–65 PSI em marcha lenta\n   - Verifique o filtro de combustível (muitas vezes negligenciado)\n   \n3. **Restrição no sistema PCV** (10%)\n   - Inspecione válvula PCV e mangueiras\n\n**Passos de diagnóstico:**\n1. Limpe o MAF com limpador CRC MAF (US$ 8,99)\n2. Confira a pressão de combustível com manômetro\n3. Inspecione o sistema PCV\n\n**Peças que você pode precisar:**\n- [Sensor MAF Motorcraft - US$ 89,99](link)\n- [Filtro de combustível - US$ 24,99](link)\n\nQual é a pressão de combustível que você está lendo?\n```\n\n### Entendendo as respostas do Madness\n\nO Madness sempre formata as respostas com:\n- **🔧 Títulos em negrito** para os principais tópicos\n- **Listas** para passos e itens\n- **Emojis** para dar clareza visual 🚗⚙️🔍\n- **Links clicáveis** para peças (em azul)\n- **Procedimentos passo a passo** numerados\n\n### Mantendo a conversa\n\n**O MadnessBot lembra tudo o que foi discutido!**\n\nVocê pode:\n- Fazer perguntas de acompanhamento\n- Pedir esclarecimentos\n- Aprofundar o diagnóstico\n- Mudar de assunto (o Madness acompanha tudo)\n\n**Exemplo:**\n```\nVocê: Qual é a sua leitura de pressão de combustível?\n\nMadness: Estou vendo 52 PSI em marcha lenta\n\nVocê: Está um pouco baixa. A especificação é 55–65. Verifique o filtro de combustível primeiro —\né barato e costuma ser o culpado. Se a pressão continuar baixa depois\nde trocar o filtro, provavelmente é a bomba de combustível fraca.\n\nTempo de mão de obra: 0,5 h para o filtro, 2,5 h para a bomba.\n```\n\n---"
